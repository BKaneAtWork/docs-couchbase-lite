In Couchbase Lite 2.0, document conflicts are automatically resolved.
This functionality aims to simplify the default behavior of conflict handling and save disk space (conflicting revisions will no longer be stored in the database).
There are 2 different `save` method signatures to specify how to handle a possible conflict:

* `save(document: MutableDocument)`: when concurrent writes to an individual record occur, the conflict is automatically resolved and only one non-conflicting document update is stored in the database.
The Last-Write-Win (LWW) algorithm is used to pick the winning revision.
* `save(document: MutableDocument, concurrencyControl: ConcurrencyControl)`: attempts to save the document with a concurrency control.
The concurrency control parameter has two possible values:
 ** `lastWriteWins`: The last operation wins if there is a conflict.
 ** `failOnConflict`: The operation will fail if there is a conflict.

Similarly to the save operation, the delete operation also has two method signatures to specify how to handle a possible conflict:

* `delete(document: Document)`: The last write will win if there is a conflict.
* `delete(document: Document, concurrencyControl: ConcurrencyControl)`: attemps to delete the document with a concurrency control.
The concurrency control parameter has two possible values:
 ** `lastWriteWins`: The last operation wins if there is a conflict.
 ** `failOnConflict`: The operation will fail if there is a conflict.
