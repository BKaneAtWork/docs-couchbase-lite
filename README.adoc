= Couchbase Lite Documentation

== Source File

The documentation for each SDK is kept in a single AsciiDoc file:

- https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/swift.html[Swift] | link:modules/ROOT/pages/swift.adoc[swift.adoc]
- https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/java.html[Java] | link:modules/ROOT/pages/java.adoc[java.adoc]
- https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/csharp.html[C#] | link:modules/ROOT/pages/csharp.adoc[csharp.adoc]
- https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/objc.html[Objective-C] | link:modules/ROOT/pages/objc.adoc[objc.adoc]

== Release Notes

Tasks to prepare release notes (the process is the same on all platforms):

. Copy the "Bugs" and "Known Issues" list from http://docs-build.sc.couchbase.com/release-notes/raw.html[raw.html] to the SDK's <<source-file>> under the `== Release Notes` heading. Example: https://github.com/couchbase/docs-couchbase-lite/commit/24ba5e56e3e8ae2588ff3c54e4374520a8037c68[24ba5e5]
. Commit on the release branch.
. Push to GitHub.

// === How are the Bugs/Known Issue lists created?
//
// The script which outputs the contents of **raw.html** captures any issue where the **Issue Type** is **Bug**.
// To remove an issue from the **Bugs** list you can make it **Private** or change the **Issue Type** to a **Task** or **Improvement**.
//
// To change the text, you can update the issue title to see it reflected on **raw.html**.
//
